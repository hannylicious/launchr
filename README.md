    Launchr is an open source SaaS starter kit.<br> 
</p>

## About

Launchr is a fully-equipped starter template, ready to start a SaaS web app. It implements the whole payment flow +
subscription management and comes with user authentication & registration and a ton of
other [features](https://getlaunchr.com/).

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

If you want to try out Launchr, follow the examples below.

### Prerequisites

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installing

To create a new project, open up a terminal and clone Launchr to your current working directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/hannylicious/launchr.git
```

Move the repository you just cloned to the one your are going to use for your project:

```
mv launchr project_name
```

Switch to your newly created project directory and start the stack:

```
cd project_name
docker-compose up
```

Once Docker is finished downloading and building, open up a second terminal and run the initial migrations for the
project:

```
docker-compose run app python manage.py migrate
```

You should now be able to reach your local development server by
visiting [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

### Where to go from here?

One of the first things you want to do is to set up [payments via Stripe](https://getlaunchr.com/docs/payments/).
